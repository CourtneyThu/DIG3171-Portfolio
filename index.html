<h1>Hello and Welcome to Courtney's Portfolio!</h1>
 
    <p>I have developed my strong skills through my academic coursework, professional experiences, and extracurricular involvement. As a Writing and Rhetoric major with a minor in Legal Studies and a certificate in Artificial Intelligence, I have gained valuable knowledge in research, analysis, and effective communication. My work experience, including serving as a resident assistant and interning in case management, has strengthened my organizational abilities, leadership, and adaptability. These opportunities have allowed me to combine my academic learning with practical skills, preparing me to contribute effectively in professional and legal settings.

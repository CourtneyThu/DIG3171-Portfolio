Revealing Bias: Navigating Search Engines Through Interactive Storytelling
Search engines shape what we see, but how often do we pause to question what is hidden or prioritized? This project invites users to step into the role of an online researcher and experience how algorithms shape knowledge and perception.
Algorithms embedded in everyday search tools affect millions of people, influencing everything from shopping results to perceptions of identity and culture. Scholars such as Safiya Noble have shown that these systems can reinforce stereotypes and inequalities rather than simply reflect the world neutrally (“Algorithms of Oppression”). Understanding these biases is crucial because search results often frame how students, consumers, and citizens learn about topics.
My project focuses on turning Noble’s research into an interactive learning experience. Using Twine, I built a branching narrative where users make choices about whether to dig deeper into results or accept surface-level answers. This structure mirrors real-world decision-making and highlights how different search strategies can either reveal or obscure bias. Storyboarding helped me plan how each decision point could teach about algorithmic bias and the power of questioning search results.
Key findings from my research include recognizing that bias appears not only in overtly political or controversial searches but also in everyday topics such as hairstyles or academic achievement gaps (Noble). I found that pairing examples like these with interactive choices helps users better grasp how algorithms prioritize certain narratives while minimizing others. By condensing Noble’s extensive research into a more approachable, game-like format, I aim to make the underlying issues more relatable.
This project underscores the need for digital literacy in understanding search tools. By presenting bias as something users can explore rather than passively consume, the Twine narrative invites critical thinking about the systems shaping our knowledge. For my final version, I plan to add simulated search result visuals to further develop the researcher character and guide users through the experience.

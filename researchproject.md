# My Final Research Project  

This is a big project, and you definitely want a place to show it off! Here's a suggested layout for that (but feel free to display your work however you prefer).
You can link to your project here, or embed it.
If it is easier to embed your project in an HTML file, just change the .md on this one to .html, and write in HTML! (Be sure to update the links to this page to reflect the new name though!)

Reimaging Creativity: The Ethics and Authorship of AI Generated Art

In recent years, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL.E, and Midjourney have all changed the way we think about creativity and authorship. As artificial intelligence systems gain the capacity to produce original works of text and imagery, they have changed the assumptions about what it means to create and who gets credit for the creation. This project will explore the ethical and social implications of AI generated art which will focus on how these tools will expand and complicate the boundaries of human artistic expression. 
By using Twine, I have designed an interactive narrative that places users in the role of an artist, an AI developer, and a museum curator. Through each perspective the users are able to make choices that reveal the dynamics of creativity, labor, and ownership in an automated creative landscape. Twine’s branching structure enables the audience to a participatory experience, inviting users to reflect on their own ethical positions as they are able to navigate dilemmas surrounding originality, collaboration, and authorship. 
The scholarly discussion about AI art emphasizes how machine learning systems can “introduce new aesthetic paradigms that redefine creativity itself,” (Elgammal et al. 395). Researchers such as McCosker and Wilken argued that AI generated works reflect on “the entanglement of human and machine perception,” in digital culture, blurring distinctions between the tools and creators (531). Kate Crawford notes that the myth of AI as autonomous artistry obscures the vast human labor and the resources behind this creation (Crawford 47.)Similarly, Joanna Zylinska contends that AI art reconfigures “the ethics of perception and production,” forcing society to rethink authorship as a distributed process rather than just a solidary act (Zylinska 112). Finally, Miles Brundage and colleagues argue that the ethical design and the policy framework are essential to ensure generative AI benefits creativity rather than undermining it (Brundage et al. 15). My project has built on these insights by translating these complex debates into an interactive format that allows the audience to feel the consequences of each ethical stance rather than merely read about them. 
Ultimately, in this project it calls attention to the tensions between innovation and exploitation in digital culture. By using interactive storytelling to explore these tensions, it encourages audiences to consider whether AI generated art represents the evolution of creativity or its commodification.

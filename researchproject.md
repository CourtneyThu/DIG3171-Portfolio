Creativity at the Crossroads: Exploring Ethics and Authorship in AI Art examines how generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Midjourney are reshaping our understanding of creativity, originality, and authorship. The project builds on my research into the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in artistic and rhetorical spaces, where human and machine contributions increasingly intersect.

Through an interactive Twine narrative and a Voyant text analysis, this project invites audiences to engage with three distinct perspectives: the artist, who struggles with the tension between authenticity and efficiency; the AI developer, who faces moral responsibility for technological innovation; and the museum curator, who navigates institutional questions of ownership, value, and public trust.

By combining storytelling with data visualization, the project encourages critical reflection on how creativity in the age of AI is both expanded and challenged by automation. The research draws on scholarly discussions of digital authorship, posthuman ethics, and creative labor to reveal how generative AI blurs the boundary between “tool” and “collaborator.” Ultimately, the project argues that AI-generated art demands not only technical literacy but also cultural and ethical sensitivity from creators, audiences, and institutions alike.
